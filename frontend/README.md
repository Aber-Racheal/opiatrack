# OpiaTrack 🛵💰

**OpiaTrack** is a **financial tracking Progressive Web App (PWA)** designed specifically for small-scale entrepreneurs, market vendors, boda boda riders, and everyday earners in **Lira, Northern Uganda**.

The word "**Opia**" is a local slang term used among business people in the region, symbolizing money and income. The app’s purpose is to help users manage their finances **simply**, **securely**, and **offline** — replacing fragile pen-and-paper records with something powerful and accessible.

## 🌍 Why OpiaTrack?

In many parts of Northern Uganda, most people still manage money using notebooks or memory. These can be:

- Easily **lost or damaged**
- Not suitable for tracking income vs expenses
- Difficult to plan future financial goals

**OpiaTrack solves this by offering a mobile-first, offline-capable app** that works even without an internet connection and doesn't require installation from the Play Store.
